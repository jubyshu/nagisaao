#### Blog

Start with WordPress from 2015, and switch to Jekyll in 2018. The source code is on [Github](https://github.com/jubyshu/nagisaao) and deloyed with Netlify. Use DisqusJS as the comment system, and all the posts only represent Juby's own opinions.

"渚碧" is a transliteration of "Juby" which is the abbreviation of my name. It can be explained as "青い渚" in Japanese, which means "blue beach".

#### Me

I'm very fond of two lines of a poem written by Ya Xian(瘂弦):

> 想著，生活著，偶爾也微笑著  
> Thinking, living, and smiling at times
> 
> 既不快活也不不快活  
> Neither happy nor unhappy

My life is as simple as this, there's nothing to sell, and there's nothing I want to buy. Only wish to plant some roses when I grow vegetables in the yard.

Can't be bother to learn and think, not good at speech and not aggressive. I love literature, heavy mental music, the mysterious universe and FOSS, and dislike many many things.

Often I haunt in dreams, riding and music, you can contact me via [Email](mailto:hbt5aggwr@relay.firefox.com). I also create a [Signal](https://bit.ly/3rMIP6f) group although I seldom use it now.
