#### Blog

I started my blog on WordPress in 2015 and migrated it to Jekyll in 2018. The source code is hosted on GitHub and deployed via Netlify.

"渚碧" is a transliteration of "Juby", which is an abbreviation of my name. It can be interpreted as "青い渚" in Japanese, meaning "azure shore".

#### Me

I'm deeply fond of two lines from the poet Ya Xian(瘂弦):

> 想著，生活著，偶爾也微笑著  
> Thinking, living, and smiling at times
> 
> 既不快活也不不快活  
> Neither happy nor unhappy

My life is as simple as this. There's nothing to sell, nothing I'd like to pursue--except freedom. Only wish to plant some roses while growing vegetables in my yard.

Can't be bother to learn and think, not good at speech and not aggressive. I love literature, heavy mental music, mysterious universe and FOSS, and dislike many many things.

Often I drift in dreams, ride on the road, lost in music or books, and keep the lights on. Feel free to reach me via email(*hi#jubeny.com*).
