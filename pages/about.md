Start with WordPress from 2015, and switch to Jekyll in 2018. The source code is on Github and deloyed with Netlify. Use DisqusJS as the comment system, and all the posts only represent Juby's own opinions.

"渚碧" is a transliteration of "Juby" which is the abbreviation of my name. It can be explained as "青い渚" in Japanese, which means "blue beach".

#### Me

I'm very fond of two lines of a poem written by Ya Xian(瘂弦):

> 想著，生活著，偶爾也微笑著  
> Thinking, living, and smiling at times
> 
> 既不快活也不不快活  
> Neither happy nor unhappy

My life is as simple as this, there's nothing to sell, and there's nothing I want to pursue. Only wish to plant some roses while growing vegetables in my yard.

Can't be bother to learn and think, not good at speech and not aggressive. I love freedom, literature, heavy mental music, the mysterious universe and FOSS, and dislike many many things.

Often I haunt in dreams, riding and music, you can contact me via [Email](mailto:hbt5aggwr@relay.firefox.com).
